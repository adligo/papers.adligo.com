A Directed Adjacency Matrix represents [Nodes#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14.0](../abstract/Graphs.md#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14.0) (usually represented by circles) and [Edges#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14.1](../abstract/Graphs.md#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14.1) (usually represented by [curved] lines or arrows) which may belong to a single [Graph#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14](../abstract/Graphs.md) or [GraphSet#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.15](../abstract/NodeNetworkSets.md).  DirectedAdjacencyMatrices are often simply called adjacency matrices.

Although DirectedAdjacencyMatrices are often used to represent single [Graphs#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14](../abstract/Graphs.md). They may also represent a 
[GraphSet#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.15](../abstract/NodeNetworkSets.md) of multiple [Graphs#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14](../abstract/Graphs.md) which are not connected by any [Edges#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14.1](../abstract/Graphs.md#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14.1).  In other words, a [Graph#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14](../abstract/Graphs.md) can be represented by a Directed Adjacency Matrix, however a Directed Adjacency Matrix it does not imply that only a single graph exists in the matrix.
