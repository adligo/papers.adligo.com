A list is a simple abstract data structure that is derived from plain English.  I.E. a laundry list or grocery list;

- Apples
- Beer
- Bread
- Curry
- Wine

A list is a abstract data structure simply because there are several concrete data structures that represent the same concept.  Most notably ArrayLists, LinkedLists and DoublyLinkedLists;
