HashCodes are simply integer numbers that can identify information, often used in conjunction with [HashTables#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.4].  A single integer is generally calculated per [Datum#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.5.0.1.6](../normalization/RelationalNormalForms.md#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.5.0.1.6).  HashCodes are often ephemeral unlike [ConsistentHashCodes#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.4.1](ConsistentHashCodes.md). HashCodes are not data structures, however this seemed like the most logical place to track their definition.
