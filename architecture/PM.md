1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.3.32

Passive Modeling (aka sleeping models) are models that do not have any methods (aka functions) which send events to other parts of a software system.  Passive modeling architecture is used in conjunction with [Model View Presenter#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.3.97](MVP.md) and [Model View Attendant#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.3.100](MV@.md) architectures.
