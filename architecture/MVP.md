## Notes

Historically, there may be some confusion about IBM's MVP and Martin Fowler's Supervising Controller (or Presenter) pattern.  I remember at one point Martin Fowler's pattern was called MVP, and then it seems to have changed.  I believe this may be due to IBM's influence, however, I could also be mistaken.
