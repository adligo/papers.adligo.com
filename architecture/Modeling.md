1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.3.20

In modern software architecture and design, it is common practice to model the problem domain using [Classes#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.3.30](Classes.md).  This is likely a tradition inspired by various forms of  [Mathmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model), since many of the early computer scientists were also mathematicians.
