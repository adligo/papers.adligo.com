Before electronic software existed, "programming" was a physical act.

The Style: Mechanical and manual configuration.

How it worked: For Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine (conceptualized in the 1840s), Ada Lovelace wrote the first "code" as sequences of operations for a mechanical machine.

Electronic Era: For the ENIAC (1945), programming involved manually re-routing cables and setting physical switches. There was no stored program; the machine was the program.
