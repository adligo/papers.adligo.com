The Imperative Style was codified, evolved and continues to evolve in the 21st century.  It is a style of programming that is based on the idea that programs can be decomposed in to steps or lists of instructions that should be executed in order.  The steps are called statements and can be aggregated into procedures, methods, routines, functions, and or subroutines.
