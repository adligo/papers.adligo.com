Vectors have different meanings depending on the context (Geometry, Physics, Calculus, Natural Sciences, etc).  However, they do all seem to generally have a starting point, ending point and direction.  

### Notes

The Java Vector class seems to buck this mathmatical convention by providing a growable data structure.
