# Walk

1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.0.0.1

To enumerate or traverse through a [Collection#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.17](../../data_structures/abstract/Collections.md).  In other words this can be the simplest kind of loop over simple [Collections#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.17](../../data_structures/abstract/Collections.md) of items like [Arrays#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.1.0](../../data_structures/Arrays.md).  However, this can also be a fairly complex operation of visiting nodes in a [Graph#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.1.0.14](../../data_structures/abstract/Graphs.md).

### Notes

This was not named enumerate in order to adhere to the convention of calling an enumeration (often a type safe enum) a noun.

This was not named traversal, because the term walk appeared in a lot of Graph Theory literature.  

This was not named iteration, to align with the Java definitions of Iteration and Enumeration.
